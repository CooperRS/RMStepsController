RMDateSelectionViewController
=============================

This is an iOS control for guiding users through a process step-by-step

##Installation
TODO...

##Usage
TODO...

## Requirements
Works with:

* Xcode 5
* iOS 7 SDK
* ARC (You can turn it on and off on a per file basis)

May also work with previous Xcode and iOS SDK versions. But it will at least need a system capable of Autolayout (and I think it will look awful on iOS 6 ;)...)
