## Installation
### Manual
1. Check out the project
2. Add all files in `RMStepsController` folder to Xcode

### CocoaPods
```ruby
platform :ios, '7.0'
pod "RMStepsController", "~> 1.0.2"
```

## Usage
### Basic
1. Create a subclass of `RMStepsController` in your project.
	
	```objc
	#import "RMStepsController.h"
	
	@interface YourStepsController : RMStepsController
	@end
	```
	
	```objc
	#import "YourStepsController.h"
	
	@implementation YourStepsController
	@end
	```
	
2. Implement `-(NSArray *)stepViewControllers` and return the view controllers of your steps.
	
	```objc
	- (NSArray *)stepViewControllers {
   		UIViewController *firstStep = [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"SomeStep"];
	    firstStep.step.title = @"First";
 		
    	UIViewController *secondStep = [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"SomeStep2"];
    	secondStep.step.title = @"Second";
    	
    	return @[firstStep, secondStep];
	}
	```
	
3. Implement `-(void)finishedAllSteps` and `-(void)canceled`
	
	```objc
	- (void)finishedAllSteps {
    	[self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
	}

	- (void)canceled {
    	[self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
	}
	```
	
4. Open `YourStepsController` by presenting it modally or pushing it in a navigation controller.

## Documentation
There is an additional documentation available provided by the CocoaPods team. Take a look at [cocoadocs.org](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/RMStepsController/).

## Requirements
Works with:

* Xcode 5
* iOS 7 SDK
* ARC (You can turn it on and off on a per file basis)

May also work with previous Xcode and iOS SDK versions. But it will at least need a system capable of Autolayout (and I think it will look awful on iOS 6 ;)...)
